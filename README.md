# RaspGuard
A tiny DIY home video security tool for Raspberry Pi. Written in Python using OpenCV and Telegram API (for notifications). 

## About RaspGuard
It is quite dark near my apartment entrance door, so in addition to a motion light sensor I have written this small script which tracks 
any motion when light turns on and sends me a GIF animation in a private telegram group. See `raspguard/settings.py` to configure telegram.
